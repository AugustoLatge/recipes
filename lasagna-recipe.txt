Ingredients
1 pound lean ground beef
4 cups tomato-basil pasta sauce
6 uncooked lasagna noodles
1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese
2 1/2 cups (10 ounces) shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup hot water

How to Make It
Step 1
Cook beef in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring until it crumbles and is
no longer pink; drain. Stir in pasta sauce.

Step 2
Spread one-third of meat sauce in a lightly greased 11- x 7-inch baking dish;
layer with 3 noodles and half each of ricotta cheese and mozzarella cheese. (The
ricotta cheese layers will be thin.) Repeat procedure; spread remaining
one-third of meat sauce over mozzarella cheese. Slowly pour 1/4 cup hot water
around inside edge of dish. Tightly cover baking dish with 2 layers of
heavy-duty aluminum foil.

Step 3
Bake at 375° for 45 minutes; uncover and bake 10 more minutes. Let stand 10
minutes before serving.

Step 4
Note: For testing purposes only, we used Classico Tomato & Basil pasta sauce.

Chef's Notes
This dish pairs well with green beans, mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, salad, or
an assortment of roasted vegetables. One could swap out the beef for chicken or 
sausage, or one could replace red sauce with white sauce. Additional cheeses
could also be added. When entertaining guests, this could be served with the
classic bread and salad combination.
